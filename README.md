# GettingAndCleaningData
This repository will hold Course work for GettingAndCleaningData Module

The run_analysis.R contains the script that cleans the data that can be downloaded and unzipped into the working-directory from the following link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
The data is cleaned up and a tidy dataset is created.

The repository also contains a CodeBook.md (markdown) that describes the variables in the run_analysis.R and the steps/data transformation it performs.
