# GettingAndCleaningData
This repository will hold Course work for GettingAndCleaningData Module

The run_analysis.R contains the script that cleans "Samsung" data and produces a tidy dataset.
The repository also contains a CodeBook.md (markdown) that describes the variables in the run_analysis.R and the steps/data transformation it performs.
